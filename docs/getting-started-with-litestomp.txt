Overview

Using litestomp is as simple as:

    Initializing APR
    Establishing a stomp connection
    Reading and writting simple stomp frames
    Disconnecting
    APR shutdown

See the litestomp Examples
Initializing APR

The following snipplet of code initializes the APR runtime.
apr_status_t rc;
rc = apr_initialize();
Establish the Stomp Connection

Here's what's required to establish the Stomp connection. Notice that an APR memory pool is used to allocate the connection.
stomp_connection *connection;
apr_pool_t *pool;
 
rc = apr_pool_create(&pool, NULL);
rc=stomp_connect( &connection, "localhost", 41414, pool);
Reading and Writting Simple Stomp Frames

A Stomp frame is made up of 3 parts: a command, a set of header properties, and a body. Here's how you can initialize the frame and write it to the connection.
stomp_frame frame;
frame.command = "CONNECT";
frame.headers = apr_hash_make(pool);
apr_hash_set(frame.headers, "login", APR_HASH_KEY_STRING, "hchirino");         
apr_hash_set(frame.headers, "passcode", APR_HASH_KEY_STRING, "letmein");         
frame.body = NULL;
rc = stomp_write(connection, &frame);

To read a Stomp frame from the connection:
stomp_frame *frame;
rc = stomp_read(connection, &frame, pool);
Disconnecting

Closing a connection that was previously created with stomp_connect is done with:
rc=stomp_disconnect(&connection);
APR Shutdown

Shutting down APR is simply done using:
apr_terminate();
