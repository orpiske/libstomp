This library implements STOMP, a simple text oriented messaging\r\nprotocol that can be used to talk to message brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ, \r\nRabbitMQ and Apache Artemis.\r\n\r\nThis library supports the version 1.2 of the STOMP protocol as documented by:\r\nhttps://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html.\r\n\r\nProject documentation, as well as examples, can be found here:\r\nhttp://orpiske.net/files/litestomp/html/index.html.\r\n\r\nBinary packages for Fedora, CentOS (and RHEL) can be found at this COPR page: \r\nhttps://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/orpiske/litestomp/\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contribute to make this library better.\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n----\r\n\r\nRuntime/Compilation:\r\n* cmake\r\n* gcc or clang\r\n* qpid-proton-c-devel\r\n* apr-devel\r\n* apr-util-devel\r\n",
